A full-stack Sweet Shop Management System built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. This project demonstrates clean backend API design, secure authentication, database integration, a modern frontend SPA, and responsible usage of AI tools in a real-world development workflow.

The application allows users to browse and purchase sweets, while admin users can manage inventory, pricing, and stock levels through a secure, role-based system.
